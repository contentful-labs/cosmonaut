# COSMONAUT

Cosmonaut is an app for exploring the structure of Contentful Spaces.

A Space is a container for content in
[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com). Contentful is an API-based
content-management system for web and mobile apps. The Conten Model is
a Space's structure which defines what kind of content can go in a
Space and what the relationships between chunks of content are.

Cosmonaut is based on [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and
uses [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) for
bundling.
